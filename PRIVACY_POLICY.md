Refund Policy

At King Tut Royal, our luxury travel experiences are curated with third-party partners including airlines, hotels, venues, and event organizers. As such, our refund policy is as follows:

1. No Refunds – Once a booking is confirmed and payment has been made, no refunds will be issued. This applies to cancellations, no-shows, or changes initiated by the client.


2. Force Majeure & Special Circumstances – In cases of force majeure (including but not limited to natural disasters, political unrest, pandemics, or governmental restrictions), or if clients face exceptional personal circumstances, bookings may be postponed to alternative available dates, subject to partner availability. Additional costs (if any) are borne by the client.


3. Partner Policies – As all bookings involve third-party providers (airlines, hotels, event partners, etc.), their individual terms and conditions also apply. Clients agree to abide by these terms upon booking.


4. Discretionary Support – While refunds are not permitted, SY Consulting FZ-LLC will make reasonable efforts to negotiate postponements or credits with service providers where possible, in the best interest of the client.
