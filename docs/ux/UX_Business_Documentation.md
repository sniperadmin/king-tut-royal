# UX Business Documentation: Admin CRM & Page Builder

## 1. Vision & Goals
Build a CRM-like admin to manage, build, and edit the full homepage (and other pages) via a visual Page Builder. Empower non-technical users to assemble pages using reusable sections and components, while maintaining brand consistency through design tokens and themes.

Business outcomes:
- Faster time-to-market for landing pages and homepage iterations
- Consistent brand experience across pages
- Reduced developer involvement for routine content/layout updates
- Analytics-backed iteration via A/B testing and drafts/previews

## 2. Key Personas
- Admin (Owner/Marketing): Creates pages, edits content, publishes updates
- Designer: Configures themes, tokens, spacing, typography; curates section templates
- Content Editor: Updates copy/media; manages media library
- Developer (Internal): Maintains components, adds new blocks, safeguards performance

## 3. Primary User Flows
1) Login → Dashboard → Page Builder → Edit Sections → Preview → Publish
2) Theme Customizer → Adjust tokens → Save Draft → Apply globally
3) Media Manager → Upload → Tag/Categorize → Insert into Section
4) Templates Library → Insert prebuilt sections → Tweak content → Save as template

## 4. Information Architecture
- Dashboard: quick stats (drafts, last edited, recent media)
- Page Builder: canvas, left library, right properties panel, top bar controls
- Theme Customizer: color, typography, spacing, radii, shadows; theme presets
- Media Manager: folders, tags, search, upload, details
- Settings: roles/permissions, API keys, audit log

## 5. Page Builder UX
- Canvas: drag/drop sections; reorder; inline selection state; visibility toggles
- Section Library: categorized (Hero, Text, Gallery, Features, CTA, Contact, Media, Custom)
- Properties Panel: contextual fields for selected section (content, layout, background, spacing, alignment)
- Toolbar: page select, preview, save/publish status, undo/redo, breakpoint preview (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Draft/Publish model: non-destructive drafts; preview via URL token; publish with confirm dialog

## 6. Content Editing Patterns
- In-place fields mapped to schema (text, rich text, image, video, link, list, repeater)
- Media picker integrated with Media Manager
- Accessibility prompts (alt text required, heading hierarchy tips)
- Validation on required fields before publish

## 7. Consistency Mechanisms
- Design tokens: color, spacing, radius, typography; referenced via Tailwind CSS variables
- Section templates locked to grid and spacing defaults
- Component props typed with zod/TypeScript; forms auto-generate from schema

## 8. Error States & Empty States
- Page with no sections: helpful placeholder with CTA to add first section
- Failed save/load: toast + retry; non-blocking local buffer
- Missing media: fallback image + prompt to upload

## 9. Accessibility & Internationalization
- Ensure keyboard navigability (focus rings, reorder via keyboard)
- ARIA labels on draggable handles and tool buttons
- RTL support and locale-aware typography later

## 10. Metrics & Success Criteria
- Time to build a landing page < 30 mins
- Publish without developer help
- Theme updates propagate instantly
- Lighthouse score > 90 for performance/accessibility on public pages

## 11. Roadmap
- v1: Core builder, theme tokens, media manager, basic roles
- v1.1: Undo/redo history, snapshots, versioning
- v1.2: A/B test variants, scheduling publish, multi-language
